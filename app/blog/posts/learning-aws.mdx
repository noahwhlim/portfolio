summary: "Hosting a static site on S3"

I recently finished my AWS Cloud Practitioner course and I wanted to put it to use. Since I have had some experience with NextJS, I thought that hosting a static site with S3 would be a good first step in familiarizing myself with AWS services.

## Services used

**Route 53**
 - Purchase and register domain
 - Points domain name to server IP

**CloudFront**
 - Caches and distributes the static content globally
 - Provide SSL/TLS support

**S3**
 - Storing and serving pages

**Certificate Manager**
- Request for SSL/TLS certificate

## Process
1. Create two S3 buckets (one with www and one without)
2. Configure buckets for public access and upload files
3. Set up domain on Route 53 to route to S3 buckets
4. Set up CloudFront distribution for both S3 buckets
5. Request for certificate on Certificate Manager
6. Change Route 53 to route to CloudFront distributions


## Flowchart

This flowchart shows something similar to what I have set up minus API-GW.
