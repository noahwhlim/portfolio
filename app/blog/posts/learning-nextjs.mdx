After spending some time reading the NextJS documentation, I decided to start building my own blog following some templates and doing a little bit of researching. 

It took about 3 hours overall to create and to understand what I was building. With some previous experience in React, it wasn't too hard at all to grasp the new concepts introduced here. 

## What I built

This blog was built using NextJS, designed using TailwindCSS, and deployed on Vercel. Since Vercel is the sole developer of NextJS, the integration was seamless allowed for extremely fast deployment. 

## What is NextJS
NextJS is a React framework that supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for building web applications. It offers features like automatic code splitting, pre-rendering, and dynamic routing, making it one of the top React frameworks available.  

## What I learned

NextJS follows a simple structure of directories to create different pages. Each page has its own files which will determine what is displayed in the event of an error, when the page is loading, and what to display when the page is loaded.
