One of the most important tasks as a web developer is knowing how to create a website based on a given design. I thought it would be fun to try recreating Apple's page for iPhones with a twist. You can visit it [here](https://nextjs-pixel.vercel.app/) (It looks better on mac).

## Overview
The site is a single page application created with NextJS 13 with no links to any other pages. It is styled using Tailwind CSS which came with some downsides that will be brought up.

## The Design
I tried to replicate Apple's website as closely as possible including using their font and minimal design.

## The Hurdles
Upon finishing the project, I decided to open the page on a device other than my own and it turns out that Windows computers didn't have Apple's fonts preinstalled (shocker). I also quickly realized that the page did not look too appealing on mobile as everything was overlapping one another due to certain texts being too big and a lack of scaling. This is a problem I hope to rectify and not repeat in the future but I will leave this page as is as it was only meant to be a quick little project to make sure I knew what I learned.   

Another issue was that Tailwind just wasn't as flexible as pure CSS. Due to the cookie cutter nature of Tailwind, it was hard to adjust it to produce a replica of Apple's website where everything is built from the ground up. I could have adjusted the properties in Tailwind but that would have taken a lof of time for a small project like this. 

## Summary
#### Mistakes
- Lack of scaling for devices of different size
- Font missing
- Tailwind

#### What I can do better
- Design webpage such that it is more flexible and able to fit to different screen sizes
- Use external fonts in the future
- Use a CSS pre-processor like SASS to allow for more flexibility in design.
