## Tech stack

**NextJS 13, ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Supabase, Prisma, Stripe**

This project was an awesome intro to creating my own backend from scratch, handling everything from server logic to database integration. It really helped me get a solid understanding of how all the pieces fit together in a full-stack setup.
