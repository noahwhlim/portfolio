**Vite, ReactJS, Python, FastAPI, Docker, Azure CosmosDB, Azure for Container Apps, v0**

A URL Shortener app built on FastAPI and ReactJS, hosted on Azure. This project was intended to help me learn Azure and through this, I now have a solid grasp on the services Azure has to offer. I intentionally took longer and less straightforward ways to deploy the project in order force myself to use Azure services to fit to my needs instead of crafting my project around the easiest deployment path.
