## Tech stack

**NextJS, Flask, Python, SQLite**

This application showcases a simple full-stack setup with a Next.js frontend (React) that communicates with a Flask backend to handle database interactions using SQLite. The frontend is responsible for the user interface, while the backend provides RESTful API endpoints for handling data.
