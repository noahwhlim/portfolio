**Vite, ReactJS**

Md-to-Pdf is a simple Markdown to PDF converter. I found myself having to convert some files from Markdown to PDF for work. However, every tool I found was either filled with ads or locked behind a paywall; so I built my own. The app runs fully on the frontend and is hosted on Github Pages.
